Lox is a dynamically typed scripting language, with a Bytecode virtual machine and garbage collector built from scratch using C

### TODO:
- [ ] Implement Arrays
- [ ] Implement functions like map, filter, reduce.
- [ ] Implement higher order convinience function to read and write into files.
- [ ] Implement networking libraries(possibly in C).

#### CREDITS
This started out as my follow through of the code from Bob Nystrom's amazing book called [craftinginterpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) which avaliable online for free. In this book he explains how to build a programming language from scratch without using any external tools like lex, yacc, ANTLR etc.
